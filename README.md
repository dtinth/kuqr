When I set up servers for eXceed camp, it has only text console and no GUI.
When I want to give this server Internet access, I have to manually login to KUWIN by typing IP address.

This app generates a QR Code that can be scanned with [KUWIN Tools](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=th.ac.ku.kuwintools&hl=en).


Requirements
------------

* Ruby
* rqrcode gem
* PhantomJS
